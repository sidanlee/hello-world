# hello-world
Just another repository

Hello everyone,
My name is Dan and I'm new to GitHub.
I'm doing GitHub tutorial now, so I could use it for my job, transporting/creating/updating some homemade scripts I have for use at work.
Well, I shouldn't take too much work hours on this. Got lots of stuffs to do.
Cheers,
Dan
